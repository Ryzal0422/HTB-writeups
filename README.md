## Introduction

Hack The Box is a popular platform for learning and practicing penetration testing skills. This repository serves as a collection of writeups that document the solutions to various HTB labs. Each writeup aims to provide a clear understanding of the techniques used, making it easier for learners to follow along.

The writeups cover various aspects of cybersecurity, including:

- **Exploitation**: Techniques to gain unauthorized access.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Steps taken after gaining access.
- **Analysis**: Understanding vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.

## Topics Covered

This repository focuses on a range of topics relevant to cybersecurity and penetration testing:

- CTF (Capture The Flag)
- Cybersecurity
- Hacking
- Hack The Box
- InfoSec
- Linux
- Pentesting
- Privilege Escalation
- Red Teaming
- Reverse Engineering
- VulnServer
- Windows
- Writeups

## Getting Started

To get started with the writeups, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ryzal0422/HTB-writeups.git
```

Once you have the repository, navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd HTB-writeups
```

You can then explore the various writeups and techniques documented here. Each writeup is organized by lab, making it easy to find what you need.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the writeups, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Kali Linux**: A popular distribution for penetration testing.
- **Burp Suite**: A web application security testing tool.
- **Metasploit**: A framework for developing and executing exploit code.
- **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer.

### Installation

For some writeups, you may need specific tools or dependencies. Check the individual writeups for any additional installation instructions.

## Writeup Structure

Each writeup follows a standard structure to ensure consistency and clarity. The typical format includes:

1. **Lab Overview**: A brief description of the lab.
2. **Reconnaissance**: Information gathering techniques used.
3. **Exploitation**: Steps taken to exploit the vulnerabilities.
4. **Post-Exploitation**: Actions performed after gaining access.
5. **Conclusion**: Summary of the findings and lessons learned.

### Example Writeup

Here's a brief example of what a writeup might look like:

#### Lab Overview

This lab focuses on a vulnerable web application that allows SQL injection.

#### Reconnaissance

- Tools used: Nmap, Burp Suite
- Scanned for open ports and services.

#### Exploitation

- Found SQL injection vulnerability.
- Used a crafted payload to extract data.

#### Post-Exploitation

- Gained access to the database.
- Retrieved user credentials.

#### Conclusion

The lab provided insights into SQL injection and its implications on web security.
